\# Lineage Notes for CMF‑Diamond



This document records the developmental lineage of CMF‑Diamond,  

the high‑resolution branch of the Coherence Mirror Framework.



\## 1. Origins

CMF‑Diamond emerged from the need to extend the CMF‑Framework into a higher‑resolution  

environment capable of evaluating coherence across more complex and socially mediated domains.



\## 2. Introduction of the Fourth Mirror

The defining innovation of CMF‑Diamond was the introduction of the \*\*Social Mirror\*\*,  

which joined the empirical, conceptual, and axiological mirrors inherited from CMF.  

This addition enabled the modeling of socially distributed reasoning.



\## 3. High‑Resolution Structures

CMF‑Diamond introduced refined operators, mappings, and representational structures  

to support substrate‑agnostic coherence evaluation across all four mirrors.



\## 4. Diamond‑Level Operators

New operators were developed to handle multi‑domain interactions,  

cross‑mirror transformations, and socially mediated coherence processes.



\## 5. Integration with HECM

CMF‑Diamond provided the conceptual foundation for the high‑resolution holographic  

environment later formalized in HECM‑DIAMOND.



These lineage notes document the evolution of CMF‑Diamond and its role  

as a branch in the coherence lineage.
